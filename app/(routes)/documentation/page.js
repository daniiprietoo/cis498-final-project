          Getting‑Started Guide: This section walks you through the initial setup and
          configuration required to launch your first project. We cover environment setup,
          authentication, basic data models, and deployment workflows—providing hands‑on
          examples and code snippets so you can go from zero to production in the least
          number of steps.
